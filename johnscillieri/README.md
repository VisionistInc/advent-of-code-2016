These solutions are written in [Nim](http://nim-lang.org/).

If you have Docker installed you can run any day using the run.sh script:

    ./run.sh <day number>

e.g.

    $ ./run.sh 03
    CC: main
    Part 1 Solution: 1032
    Part 2 Solution: 1838

Otherwise if you install Nim you can run the solutions by:

    $ cd 03
    $ nim c -r main
    <.. compiler output ..>
    Part 1 Solution: 1032
    Part 2 Solution: 1838
